# 🧠 Customer Churn Prediction
This project focuses on predicting customer churn, a critical business metric that reflects when customers stop using a company's products or services. By leveraging machine learning techniques, this project aims to help businesses proactively identify customers at risk of leaving and take preventative action.

# 📂 Project Overview
Customer churn is a key challenge for subscription-based businesses. Retaining existing customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. Using a labeled churn dataset, this project builds a predictive model to classify whether a customer will churn or remain loyal.

# ✅ Goals:
Understand patterns that lead to customer churn.
* Build a machine learning pipeline for classification.
* Tune the model for optimal performance.
* Deploy the solution via a Dockerized app.

# 🧾 Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project includes customer-level information and a binary target label:
* Churned (1) – The customer has discontinued their subscription or service.
* Not Churned (0) – The customer is still active.
